#!/command/with-contenv sh

# /opt/nyxo/docker/main-wrapper.sh — wraps the container's CMD with
# the same argument-routing logic the pre-s6 entrypoint.sh used. Runs
# as /init's "main program" (Docker CMD) so it inherits stdin/stdout/
# stderr from the container.
#
# Shebang note: /init scrubs env before invoking CMD, so a plain
# `#!/bin/sh` wrapper sees an empty environ and `ENV NYXO_HOME=/opt/data`
# from the Dockerfile never reaches `nyxo`. with-contenv repopulates
# the env from /run/s6/container_environment before exec'ing, which is
# what s6-supervised services use too (see main-nyxo/run).
#
# Routing:
#   no args                       → exec `nyxo` (the default)
#   first arg is an executable    → exec it directly (sleep, bash, sh, …)
#   first arg is anything else    → exec `nyxo <args>` (subcommand passthrough)
#
# Drop to nyxo via s6-setuidgid, but skip it when already non-root.

# --- Reject the unsupported `docker run --user <uid>:<gid>` start ---
# Mirror the guard in stage2-hook.sh (cont-init). This is the surface the
# user actually sees in `docker run` output: when the container is pinned to
# an arbitrary non-root, non-nyxo UID, the bootstrap was skipped and the
# baked image dirs (owned by the nyxo build UID) are unwritable, so fail
# fast here with actionable guidance rather than crashing on `cd`/EACCES
# further down. See stage2-hook.sh for the full rationale.

[nyxo] ERROR: container started with --user $cur_uid (an arbitrary, non-nyxo UID) — not supported.

To make container-written files match your HOST user, don't use --user.
Start as root (the default) and pass your host UID/GID instead:

    docker run -e NYXO_UID=\$(id -u) -e NYXO_GID=\$(id -g) ...

NAS users (Synology / unRAID / UGOS) can use the PUID/PGID aliases:

    docker run -e PUID=\$(id -u) -e PGID=\$(id -g) ...

The image remaps the nyxo user to that UID/GID at boot and chowns the data
volume, so files land owned by your host user — the same outcome --user gave,
without breaking the s6 supervision tree.
