# Outside containers the EUID==0 case is rare; inside the production image
# the entrypoint drops to flashwebui itself, so this is a defensive guard.

# Four preconditions to fire (all must hold):
#   - EUID == 0
#   - flashwebui user actually exists (id lookup)
#   - sudo is on PATH (production image does not ship sudo, so this is the
#     load-bearing no-op guard for the canonical container path)
#   - sudo -u flashwebui passes without prompting (NOPASSWD precheck)
# The NOPASSWD precheck via `sudo -n -u flashwebui true` makes this a silent
# fall-through on host machines where the developer's flashwebui user
# requires a password — better than exiting non-zero with `sudo: a password
# is required` and surprising the user who didn't ask for sudo behavior.

# Pre-flight: detect an already-running server before launching bootstrap.py.
#
# bootstrap.py's detached (non-foreground) path spawns server.py, then probes
# /health and reports success once *anything* answers. If a server is already
# bound to this host:port, the freshly spawned child fails to bind and dies,
# but the EXISTING (often orphaned) server answers the /health probe — so
# bootstrap.py prints "ready" and exits 0 without having started anything. The
# user just keeps re-confirming the old instance on every run.
#
# To avoid that, probe /health here first. If a server is already up, tell the
# user plainly that nothing was (re)started and how to restart, then exit 0.
# ctl.sh already refuses to double-start via PID/state tracking; this brings
# the detached start.sh path to parity using a health probe (start.sh keeps no
# PID file of its own).
#

# HERMES_WEBUI_PORT (possibly just sourced from .env above), else the

     Otherwise, stop the running server and start it again manually:

            lsof -iTCP:${_flash_port} -sTCP:LISTEN      # macOS / Linux
       2. Stop it (use -9 only if it ignores a normal stop):

       3. Start it again:
